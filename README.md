# holiday tracker

## Description

A holiday tracker app created using Svelte, SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. Designed only for personal use as it doesn't have user account functionality; stores all data in an SQLite db.

Allows you to:

* View and set your annual holiday allowance total
* Add and delete holidays which are calculated against business days
* See your remaining holiday allowance
* Set (manually in the db at the moment) excluded holiday periods which cannot be booked against
* Prevent various error scenarios such as tracking more holiday than your allowance, booking holidays which start before they end, booking holidays which overlap etc.
